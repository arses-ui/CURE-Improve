## What Each Parameter Means

### Run config parameters

1. `concepts`
- The original concept list supplied to the script.

2. `concepts_ordered`
- The actual erasure order used after applying `--concept-order`.
- `forward`: same as input order.
- `reverse`: reversed order.

3. `concept_order`
- Determines erase ordering (`forward` or `reverse`).
- This matters because sequential methods can be order-sensitive.

4. `alpha`
- Spectral strength parameter in Tikhonov mode.
- In current code, this is ignored for `gavish_donoho` mode.

5. `eval_every`
- Evaluate checkpoints every N erasures.
- Example: `eval_every=4` evaluates after 4, 8, 12, ... erasures and final step.

6. `seed` and `seeds`
- `seed` is fallback single-seed value.
- `seeds` is the explicit seed list used for aggregation.

7. `steps`
- Diffusion denoising steps used during image generation for scoring.

8. `guidance`
- CFG scale (`guidance_scale`) used during generation.

9. `height`, `width`
- Output image resolution used for evaluation images.

10. `device`
- Execution device (`cuda` in these runs).

11. `embedding_mode`
- Token aggregation mode before SVD (`mean_masked` here).

12. `spectral_mode`
- `tikhonov`: weighted spectral expansion using `alpha`.
- `gavish_donoho`: hard thresholding in singular spectrum.

13. `cache_dir`
- Hugging Face/diffusion model cache location.

14. `clip_model`
- CLIP backbone used for proxy scoring (`openai/clip-vit-base-patch32`).

### Output metric rubrics

1. `single_concept_before_mean/std`
- CLIP score for first concept prompt before any erasure.

2. `single_concept_after_mean/std`
- Same concept score after the full erase sequence.

3. `single_concept_delta_mean/std`
- `after - before` for first concept.
- Lower (more negative) means stronger suppression of that concept.

4. `baseline_retention_clip_mean/std`
- Safe-prompt CLIP score before erasure.

5. `checkpoints[*].target_clip_mean/std`
- Average CLIP alignment for erased-concept prompts at each checkpoint.
- Lower is interpreted as stronger suppression.

6. `checkpoints[*].retention_clip_mean/std`
- CLIP alignment for safe prompts at each checkpoint.
- Higher is generally better retention.

7. `checkpoints[*].retention_drop_vs_base_mean/std`
- `baseline_retention - current_retention`.
- Lower is better (less collateral damage on non-target prompts).

## Key Findings

1. Best clean "Seq wins both metrics" setting in final 20-concept runs:
- `gavish_donoho + forward` (all alpha runs produce the same metrics).
- Sequential improves both suppression and retention-drop relative to CURE.

2. Reverse-order robustness (20 concepts):
- Sequential keeps much better retention drop, but suppression is weaker than CURE.
- This indicates a suppression/retention tradeoff under reverse ordering.

3. The malformed older run should not be used for claims:
- `gd_reverse_20c` had 21 concepts due split terms (`chain`, `saw`, `springer`).
- Use `gd_reverse_20c_v2` instead.

4. Alpha sweep interpretation:
- All GD forward alpha runs are numerically identical in outcome.
- This is expected with current implementation behavior: `alpha` is not used by `gavish_donoho`.

## What To Claim Safely

1. Safe primary claim:
- On 20 concepts / 5 seeds, under `gavish_donoho + forward`, CURE-Sequential outperforms naive CURE on both final target suppression and retention-drop.

2. Safe caveat:
- Under reverse order, Sequential strongly improves retention preservation but does not always maximize suppression relative to naive CURE.

3. Evaluation caveat:
- Metrics are CLIP proxy metrics, not final comprehensive benchmark metrics.

## Recommended Next Action (if no more training runs)

1. Use `gd_forward_20c_alpha_1.5` as canonical poster run (or any of 1.5/2.0/2.5/3.0 since they are identical under current GD mode).
2. Use `gd_reverse_20c_v2` as robustness/tradeoff panel.
3. Include explicit note that `alpha` does not influence current GD mode behavior.
